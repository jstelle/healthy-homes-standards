                                                    <p>The issue of lead in drinking water has been in the headlines for years. In fact, it’s one of the most common environmental contaminants in the United States. Lead, a naturally occurring substance, is found in water at low levels in most places. However, homes that are built before the 1980s are more likely to have lead pipes and fixtures connected to their water supply. Lead can be harmful to humans at any level, but especially at high levels. Lead is a known toxin that can cause serious health issues if ingested or absorbed through the skin. It can also be found in paint, dust, soil and air pollution. In fact, lead has been found in the soil of almost every American home at some point in time. Lead can be found in most household items such as water pipes, faucets, solder, soldering iron, cans, and paint. Lead is a naturally occurring element that is found in soil, air, water, and food. At low levels, it is not thought to be harmful to humans. But at higher levels, serious health issues can arise. Lead can be harmful to humans at any level, but especially at high levels.

Lead is a naturally occurring element that is found in soil, air, water, and food. At low levels, it is not thought to be harmful to humans. But at higher levels, serious health issues can arise. Lead contamination is a serious issue in many communities across the nation. In fact, the EPA estimates that there are over 5 million homes with lead pipes in the United States. This article will highlight some common sources of lead in homes.</p><h2>Water Pipes</h2><p>Water pipes are the most common source of lead in homes. Lead is found in the pipes used to deliver water to homes and businesses. Lead may also be found in the solder used to join pipes together. The most common source of lead in water pipes is from lead solder. Lead solder is used to join the pipes together. The EPA estimates that between 8% and 12% of all lead found in water pipes comes from lead solder. The other 88% to 90% comes from the pipes themselves. Lead pipes are no longer allowed in new construction. However, there are still many homes that were built with lead pipes. Lead pipes can leach lead into the water supply if they are exposed to high levels of water pressure, changes in water temperature, or if they are damaged. If you have lead pipes, you may want to consider replacing them with copper or PVC pipes.</p><h2>Soldering Iron</h2><p>Soldering is a common hobby and is used to join metal pieces together. Lead is a common metal used in solder. However, lead solder is no longer allowed in new construction. The EPA estimates that between 5% and 10% of all lead found in water pipes comes from lead solder. The other 90% to 95% comes from the pipes themselves. Soldering is a common way to repair copper pipes. If you are repairing copper pipes with lead solder, you should be very careful to avoid breathing lead dust. Lead dust can be harmful to breathe in. Lead in solder is very difficult to remove from your skin and clothing. Lead is a heavy metal and can be toxic to humans at any level. Lead can be found in many common household items such as water pipes, faucets, solder, soldering iron, cans, and paint.</p><h2>Cans and Bottles</h2><p>Cans and bottles are common containers used to store food and water. Many of these containers are made with lead. Lead is a naturally occurring substance that is found in soil, air, water, and food. Lead can be harmful to humans at any level, but especially at high levels. Lead can be found in many common household items such as water pipes, faucets, solder, soldering iron, cans, and paint.
